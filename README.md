While SAR11 marine bacteria numerically dominate microbial communities of the global surface ocean, the determinants of niche partitioning within this genetically diverse lineage remain unresolved. We analyzed 83 high-quality genomes from SAR11 strains predominately isolated from coastal and offshore waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Examination of the SAR11 metapangenome, including the distribution of metabolic gene content and the read recruitment patterns of surface ocean metagenomes, revealed ecotypic differentiation of SAR11 Ia genome clusters. Habitat preferences (i.e. coastal: Ia.3.VI, Ia.3.II, Ia.3.III or offshore: Ia.4.II, Ia.4.1483, Ia.4.RS39) and associated metabolic traits, including purine catabolism and molybdenum enzyme loss, showed polyphyletic distributions across SAR11 Ia genome clusters. Genome clusters of SAR11 Ia contain highly overlapping gene content with few genes uniquely common to any given cluster, suggesting that only a handful of distinct metabolic features may contribute to these unique ecologies. Our integrated analysis of closely related SAR11 populations that occur within <100 kilometers reveals parapatric speciation as the main driver behind the tight relationship between the ecology and metabolic landscape of marine microbes at fine scales of genetic and spatial resolution.
